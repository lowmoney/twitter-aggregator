Description: 
    This script should use the Different APIs call
    that Twitter has to offer. Using those API calls 
    we should scrape limited (initially in Columbus but will scale out) 
    public accounts for information in their tweets and retweets.
    Using the information we should use NLP to see what the true trend 
    is in social media.
